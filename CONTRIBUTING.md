## The codebase

BoarBotJE is entirely written in Java, although there are a few Python scripts used for animated image generation.

### Why Java?
- Static typing reduces runtime errors relating to types.
  - It also makes it easier to know how the code you write handles data!
- Object-Oriented Principles are integral to the Java experience.
  - This makes the structure of the software much nicer and encourages code reuse!
- Java is a language that's a nice middle ground. It does *some* of the lower-level work for you, but also gives 
developers a lot of freedom.
